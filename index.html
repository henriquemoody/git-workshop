      <h2>Commit messages</h2>
      <p>Good commit messages serve at least some important purposes:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>To speed up the reviewing process;</li>
          <li>To help developers to find out why a particular change was made to the code or why a specific feature was added;</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>That said, good commit messages should be:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Properly formatted</strong> so that they are easy to read in any type of console or application;</li>
          <li><strong>Self-explanatory</strong> so that developers do not need to go out of the <code>log</code> to understand why something happended.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
