# Web page

You are in the repository of the "Web page" project, an example page used on a
Git workshop.

Here you will find different examples of commit messages, some that are good and
some that are bad. Also, there will be examples of unnecessary merge commits.

This repository contains a page that uses only HTML and CSS.
